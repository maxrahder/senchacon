        "description": "Computing space is much more complicated today than it was 10 years ago, and it is now only natural to expect having same functionality and experience with apps and services whether you access them on your phone, tablet, desktop or (soon) even wearables. Responsiveness is a keyword that’s thrown around a lot, and while there are many ways existing technologies can help you achieve this, there is no one simple method that can be used to magically adapt an interface to different devices, and in the end nothing goes above good (interaction) design. This session will explore approaching responsiveness from the design perspective.\n\nSpeaker: Miroslav Bojic, Sencha ",

        "description": "Sencha Ext JS has always been a pioneer in widget libraries creating visual attractive interfaces out of the box allowing the creation of highly interactive single page applications. Not only did Sencha enhance the framework’s look throughout the years, but it also introduced powerful features to allow developers to customize the look and feel in an efficient way. One big step forward was the migration to Sass with Compass for styling which improved the code organization of CSS code immensely. Later the introduction of packages added support for easily adding custom themes that enhance an application’s style and components.\n\nIn 2014, Google announced Material design, a comprehensive guide for visual, motion, and interaction design across platforms and devices. Ever since, it has received praise by developers and designers. In this session, we’ll explore how to build a Material design interface on top of the most powerful enterprise JavaScript framework of today by leveraging its powerful customization features. We'll look into what makes a Material design interface, how to create a custom theme package, how to create custom components, how to create custom animations, how to make the same application mouse and touch friendly and how to make the interface responsive to desktop and tablet screens.\n\nSpeaker: Steffen Hiller, Sencha ",

When NTT embarked upon building the enterprise AOP, HTML5 was the obvious choice, given the diversity of devices and platforms being used in the field. After an extensive evaluation, Sencha was chosen as the development platform because: a) the rich set of components the Sencha Ext JS offers, and b) the cross-platform cross-browser (including legacy) compatibility of Sencha Ext JS widgets.\n\nIn this presentation, we will discuss the approach we took in designing, building and integrating the AOP with several existing systems within the NTT, and how we leveraged the Sencha Ext JS 5 for AOP to work across Desktops and Tablets. We will also touch upon our development process, and how we leveraged a Sencha partner in Japan, Xenophy, to help accelerate the development. The AOP received and internal NTT award for the best App built in 2014 - voted by NTT customers.\n\nSpeakers: Naoki Mashiko, NTT Communications Corporation & Kazuhiro Kotsutsumi, Xenophy Co., Ltd. ",

        "description": "Nielsen’s Answers On-Demand® (AOD) is an ad hoc reporting platform that provides flexible on-the-fly processing to generate insights from consumer data. The legacy AOD system was a single web application making it hard to manage functional changes. Our new solution now consists of a suite of applications including; a reporting framework, data selector, design tool and rendering engine. With this architecture, the applications can function as a suite or individual applications used to improve other legacy tools or functional components of other new solutions. The flexibility of Ext JS framework made it easy to integrate our custom built components while providing easily extendable set of core components. Some of our custom features include; application recovery (accomplished by saving sessions), the multi tab reporting capability built on tab panel, lightweight canvas layout with multiple visualization options as well as a custom page container. Following the beta release of our new platform, Nielsen’s development team partnered with Sencha engineers to look at the innovative ways we had leveraged the framework and how Sencha’s product roadmap and new feature development could continue to grow with us. Since then, we have integrated Sencha Cmd with Gradle to package, build and deploy applications. Features such as image spriting, JavaScript compiler, package management and command line syntax have proven effective during application development. Coupled with Nielsen user experience standards, Sencha Cmd has allowed Nielsen to easily build custom Ext JS themes. These themes are now widely leveraged by other Ext JS-based applications within the company. Added benefit of using the Ext JS 4.x framework was allowing AOD to become mobile friendly. Clients may use most of the application’s features on their tablets. Moving forward, we are pursuing an Ext JS 5.x migration and investigating the potential for a comprehensive mobile strategy.\n\nSpeaker: Sri Hari Gumpu Madan, Nielsen ",

        "description": "Traditionally, User Experience (UX) has only been considered in the creation of consumer applications or websites where a company is selling a product or service. In the Enterprise, UX has either been ignored or relegated to an afterthought resulting in applications that are slow, clumsy and difficult to use. One of the reasons used by Enterprise application developers for the lack of focus on UX are these apps are usually very data intensive and data doesn’t have to be “pretty”. Unfortunately users have become accustomed to software that isn’t designed for normal human consumption. Using waterfall methodologies makes improvements so cumbersome and time intensive, Enterprise applications are usually UX deficient. Sencha frameworks are geared for data intensive applications and with the use of Architect, a designer has the ability to participate much earlier in the process. Using Architect means in organizations not accustomed to spending time on UX, they can start to make apps giving users not just functionality but true usability.\n\nThis talk defines what is UX and why UX it’s important in the Enterprise. It then covers how our team uses Architect to quickly prototype a User Interface (UI) component or application feature so our stakeholders can have concrete examples of how the feature might work. It also allows us to quickly iterate changes so the feature can be refined very early in the process. UX in the Enterprise is important as users spend more time in the applications at work than nearly any other environment. Effective UX not only makes the users life more efficient but these shouldn’t just supply data, they should help users understand and interpret data.\n\nSpeaker: Peter Tierney, Williams ",

All this and more is possible by using the power of ExtJS 5 ViewModels. The new kid on the block, ExtJS 5, has offered a host of new possibilities. The new MVVM architecture is extremely powerful but can be intimidating at first, especially when coming from MVC. Once you have flipped the switch however you will wonder how you ever managed to live without it. We will show you some examples of what can be accomplished when you really start thinking out of the box, and you can do it too. ViewModels are even more powerful than most people realise, especially when combined with things like HTML5 Canvas, WebGL, Bower components and more.\n\nSpeaker: Rob Boerman, 2Gears S.a.r.l. ",

        "description": "FICO is a leading analytics software company offering a broad range of tools and applications. The Customer Communications Services (CCS) division in FICO has a mandate to empower its clients and streamline how new solutions are delivered. The project team had the ambitious idea of building a CCS Designer, a new tool with which business analysts could design and deploy new solutions without having to engage technical teams or understand the complex platform infrastructure. The team chose ExtJS to implement a user-friendly web interface on top of a secure, multi-tier Java and No-SQL application. ExtJS was selected because it provided object orientation, re-usable themes and a rich set of visual components – allowing the team to build out a solution rapidly and in line with company UX strategy. The team faced some daunting challenges. One of the first was to make the application compliant with the company’s stringent branding standards. By creating a FICO theme that was dropped into the application while it was under construction, the team addressed the challenge and led the way for future company projects. Another challenge was to encode complex business logic and requirements, such as country-specific customer contact patterns. The solution was to create a data-driven wizard that captures answers and adapts to prompt users for information based on previous responses. Visually the tool must support the presentation and editing of complex processing rules and interactive voice (IVR) flows. Learn about custom components created for status grids, wizards, resettable form-fields and REST-based stores, alongside real-world stories of lessons learned and helpful tips and tricks. How can your team realize the full power of ExtJS to maximize user experiences? Hear from FICO’s hands-on experts to get the latest insights.\n\nSpeaker: Paul Delano, FICO ",

        "description": "Writing unit tests for JavaScript based applications has been difficult at best and ignored at worst, and ExtJS is no exception. Developers tend to focus exclusively on visual testing of components which tend to get cumbersome, and expensive as projects grow in size. Most automation testing efforts tend to focus on browser specific testing based on the visual aspects of the UI using frameworks like Selenium. While this is definitely important, the product quality can also be enhanced by writing good quality unit tests. This paper describes a method to perform unit testing using Jasmine 2.0, ExtJS 5.0.x, leveraging the Sencha Command generated application workspace structure, making it easy to write and automate unit tests. It also presents some techniques to generate TestNG style automated tests with fixtures.\n\nSpeaker: Kollivakkam Raghavan, Cisco ",

Better management of memory will lead to performance improvements, enhanced capacity for running on limited resources and increased working lifecycle without crashes.\n\nThe session will give an overview to memory management in the browser and introduce common tools and techniques for identifying and investigating web application memory leaks. With practical examples, we will look at browser-based tools, such as, Memory Timeline and Heap Snapshots to equip you with the knowledge to find the problems in your own applications. Following this, we will take a deeper dive into specific areas we recommend you look at when developing Ext JS and Sencha Touch applications. You will be shown how to isolate, fix and test the main components of your Sencha apps. This will include looking at data parsing in Stores & Models, writing efficient controller code and common pitfalls in views. You’ll leave this session better equipped to find and resolve leaks in your own Sencha apps!\n\nSpeaker: Andrew Duncan, SwarmOnline ",

        "description": "Think of a step forward in the future. Do you really need to develop all the \"REST\" services by yourself? Can’t Java EE portal help you to easily plug all your enterprise services into an Ext JS front-end? Ext JS makes the web development easier than ever by providing a comprehensive framework. But what about the \"frequently expected\" business services such as social networking or document management or even technical services such as user/access control management or long-running/global transactions? Do you really need to develop them yourself?\n\nSome of you may have used Google services for document management, and other similar service platforms. They are fit for specific web and mobile development needs. But most organizations today are reluctant to entrust their critical data with such service providers. Why not simply use out-of-the-box solutions? Java EE is a good framework that answers most professional needs. It only lacks the glue that would make all its solutions work easily together. In this session, we will demonstrate how a Java EE portal such as eXo Platform can be that glue, by replacing or working alongside the service platforms you may be used to. eXo is an Enterprise Social Platform with many services and fantastic APIs. We will first show you how easy the front-end integration is and then use an out-of-the-box feature to demonstrate the eXo Platform capabilities.\n\nSpeaker: Jean-Philippe Ehret, Jnesis & Benjamin Mestrallet, eXo ",

        "description": "With the emergence of the Cloud, many firms see the importance and the necessity of re-developing their legacy internal applications on the Web in order to gain process agility and deployment efficiency. Time is precious to benefit from the competitivity Web applications offer and I had to find a way to accelerate development cycle to meet the needs of KPMG, one of the world big 4 auditors. The solution found was to generate the entire application (from its database model to its user interface) based on a graph of business classes. In order to build the stack, I chose ExtJS for the user interface layer as it offers a great flexibility and a large number of high quality components. For the business object layer, I used JavaScript language which is compatible with most devices. As for the server layer, I picked Node.js, due to its amazing speed and its integration with JavaScript. The framework implementation required the extension of many ExtJS components, the design of an asynchronous JavaScript class mechanism, the creation of an object query language and the development of a proprietary Web server powered by Node.js. With the help of a talented team it was then possible to cut development times by 5 and to reduce operating costs by 1300% in comparison to the previous application. The highly innovative character of the final application generated by the framework, combined with the full integration into ExtJS of “Sharepoint 2013” and “Office Web App”, led to a unique, much faster and 30% more productive solution than competing ones.\n\nSpeaker: Christian Taltas, KPMG",
