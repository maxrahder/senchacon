        "description": "Computing space is much more complicated today than it was 10 years ago, and it is now only natural to expect having same functionality and experience with apps and services whether you access them on your phone, tablet, desktop or (soon) even wearables. Responsiveness is a keyword that’s thrown around a lot, and while there are many ways existing technologies can help you achieve this, there is no one simple method that can be used to magically adapt an interface to different devices, and in the end nothing goes above good (interaction) design. This session will explore approaching responsiveness from the design perspective.",

        "description": "Sencha Ext JS has always been a pioneer in widget libraries creating visual attractive interfaces out of the box allowing the creation of highly interactive single page applications. Not only did Sencha enhance the framework’s look throughout the years, but it also introduced powerful features to allow developers to customize the look and feel in an efficient way. One big step forward was the migration to Sass with Compass for styling which improved the code organization of CSS code immensely. Later the introduction of packages added support for easily adding custom themes that enhance an application’s style and components.\n\nIn 2014, Google announced Material design, a comprehensive guide for visual, motion, and interaction design across platforms and devices. Ever since, it has received praise by developers and designers. In this session, we’ll explore how to build a Material design interface on top of the most powerful enterprise JavaScript framework of today by leveraging its powerful customization features. We'll look into what makes a Material design interface, how to create a custom theme package, how to create custom components, how to create custom animations, how to make the same application mouse and touch friendly and how to make the interface responsive to desktop and tablet screens.",

        "description": "Traditionally, User Experience (UX) has only been considered in the creation of consumer applications or websites where a company is selling a product or service. In the Enterprise, UX has either been ignored or relegated to an afterthought resulting in applications that are slow, clumsy and difficult to use. One of the reasons used by Enterprise application developers for the lack of focus on UX are these apps are usually very data intensive and data doesn’t have to be “pretty”. Unfortunately users have become accustomed to software that isn’t designed for normal human consumption. Using waterfall methodologies makes improvements so cumbersome and time intensive, Enterprise applications are usually UX deficient. Sencha frameworks are geared for data intensive applications and with the use of Architect, a designer has the ability to participate much earlier in the process. Using Architect means in organizations not accustomed to spending time on UX, they can start to make apps giving users not just functionality but true usability.\n\nThis talk defines what is UX and why UX it’s important in the Enterprise. It then covers how our team uses Architect to quickly prototype a User Interface (UI) component or application feature so our stakeholders can have concrete examples of how the feature might work. It also allows us to quickly iterate changes so the feature can be refined very early in the process. UX in the Enterprise is important as users spend more time in the applications at work than nearly any other environment. Effective UX not only makes the users life more efficient but these shouldn’t just supply data, they should help users understand and interpret data.",

Our engineering team was challenged to raise the bar for design, scalability, ease-of-use, and unprecedented performance with the latest version of the eVestment platform.\n\nDuring this session, we will explore how we have met the challenge with the latest version of the eVestment Platform with the help of Sencha Ext JS 5, the creative use of NoSQL and caching technologies, a fast prototyping mindset, and a modern service architecture. Session format will be an interactive and in-depth demonstration of the platform and the specific Ext frameworks and techniques that power our big data analytics for the world’s largest institutional investors and asset managers.",
